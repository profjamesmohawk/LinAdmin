<h1>Graded Lab: Routing </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">
The configuration we built in the routing lab has proved useful but the owners of s01 are upset. It seems they resent their expensive server being used as a router for those lazy no good owners of s02.  Your boss has commanded you to "stop using s01 as a router, but maintain the yellow and blue network separation."  Fortunately, you have an extra small server with two NICs in inventory.  Your task is to deploy it as a router named r01.
</p>
<h3>Here is what you will build today</h3>

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<h3>Before you start this lab you must have:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The comp-10018 virtual lab appliance, <strong>comp-10018-vlab.ova</strong> found on the CSAIT lab systems.</li>
		<li>Oracle VirtualBox software, found on all lab systems at the college and available from <a href="http://virtualbox.org" target="blank">http://virtualbox.org</a>
	</ul>

<h2>Grading:</h2>
<p class="description">
You will run a host info script on s02 and on w01 submitting two output files to Canvas.

<h2>Part A: Setup The Lab</h2>
<p class="description">
Use VirturalBox cloning to create the VM's you need.  Both <strong>r01</strong> and <strong>s02</strong> should be created by cloning <strong>s01</strong>
</p>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ol>
<li>s02 must be able to communicate with s01 and w01 </li>
<li>hosts files must be updated as appropriate.   With host names <strong>r01yellow</strong> and <strong>r01blue</strong> configured.  </li>
<li>w01 must continue to have internet access. </li>
<li>Install the <span class=cmd>traceroute</span> command on <strong>s02</strong> (it is on y01)
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Disable the firewall on r01
<pre class="code">
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl stop firewalld
</pre>
</li>
<li>Add a default gateway to y01 </li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Part B: Evaluation</h2>
<p class="description">
Run the host info script, <a href="./host_info_routing.zip">host_info_routing.sh</a> on each of <strong>s02</strong> and <strong>w01</strong> and submit the output files to Canvas.
