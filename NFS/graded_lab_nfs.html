<h1>Graded Lab: NFS </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">
Today you will demonstrate you mastery of NFS.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>Grading:</h2>
<p class="description">
You will run the host_info_nfs script on <strong>s01</strong> and submit the output to Canvas. <a href="./host_info_nfs.zip">(host_info_nfs.zip)</a>
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Part A: Setup the lab</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Import the appliance which contains w01 and s01.  </li>
	<li>Install the NFS utilities on all systems </li>
	<li>Make sure NFS is set to start automatically on s01 </li>
	<li>Create users on <strong>w01 <em>and</em> s01</strong>  making sure they have consistent UID numbers.
		<table>
<tr>
	<td>Full Name</td>
	<td>Employee Number</td>
	<td>Department</td>
	<td>User Name</td>
	<tr>
	<td>Margaret Hamilton</td>
	<td>2000</td>
	<td>research</td>
	<td>margaret</td>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Katherine Johnson</td>
	<td>2001</td>
	<td>research</td>
	<td>katherine</td>

</tr>

</table>
<strong>Note:</strong> Running <span class=cmd>useradd</span> on w01 will likely result in warnings from sss_cache.  You can safely ignore these warnings.  You can stop the warnings by running <span class=cmd>rm /var/lib/sss/db/*</span> on w01.
	</li>
	<li>Create an group named <strong>research</strong> containing margaret and katherine on both systems.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Part B: Create "scratch" share</h2>
<p class="description">
Create and export a directory named <strong>/nfs_shares/scratch</strong> for use as a temporary directory by any and all users on <strong>w01</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The share is exported from <strong>s01</strong> </li>
<li>All users, including root should have read and write access </li>
<li>root on w01 should have root level access to the share </li>
</ul>
<p class="description">
Test your work by mounting <strong>/nfs_shares/scratch</strong> on <strong>w01</strong> and having root, margaret, and katherine each create a file.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Part C: Create a research share</h2>
<p class="description">
Create and export a directory named <strong>/nfs_shares/research</strong> that is accessible only to the members of the research group on w01.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The share is exported from <strong>s01</strong> </li>
<li>Neither root or alice on w01 should be able to access the share </li>
<li>Both margaret and katherine must be able to create and delete files on the share </li>
<li>When members of the research group create files on the share, the files group ownership must be set to <strong>research</strong> automatically. <em>hint: google "setgid bit on directory"</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="description">
Test your work by mounting <strong>/nfs_shares/research</strong> on <strong>w01</strong> and having margaret, and katherine each create a file.  Verify that neither alice or root can access the files from w01.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Part D: Create A Public Share</h2>
<p class="description">
Create and export a directory named <strong>/nfs_shares/pub</strong> from <strong>s01</strong> as a public playground share.  This one is a little different than what you've seen so far, some research will be required.
</p>
<ul>
<li>All users, including root, on w01 must have full access to the share </li>
<li>All users must appear as the user <em>w01_guest</em> when performing operations on the share.  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Part E: Evaluation</h2>
<ol>
<li>The script needs the <span class=cmd>netstat</span> command to check for an active NFS connection.  It is contained in the <strong>net-tools</strong> package.
<pre class="code">
yum install net-tools
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
Run <a href="./host_info_nfs.zip"host_info_nfs.sh>host_info_nfs.zip</a>  on <strong>s01</strong> and submit the output to the Canvas dropbox for this lab.
